Predicting the Sale Price of Houses in Ames, Iowa using R

## Problem Statement

The Ames, Iowa association of realtors has hired your team to analyze historical data and determine if there are any differences in the drivers of housing prices before and after the housing price crash in the 2000s. Your first task is to analyze housing data from the 2000s and identify the attributes of houses that affect purchase price. Your success in this task will determine if you are hired for a follow-up project analyzing more current housing data. You are expected to create a predictive model that accurately predicts housing prices while also identifying the most significant attributes associated with house prices and estimating the quantitative relationship between those attributes and price.
